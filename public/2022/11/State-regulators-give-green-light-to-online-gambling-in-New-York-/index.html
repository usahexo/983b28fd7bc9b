      <h1 id="State-regulators-give-green-light-to-online-gambling-in-New-York"><a href="#State-regulators-give-green-light-to-online-gambling-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="State regulators give green light to online gambling in New York"></a>State regulators give green light to online gambling in New York</h1><p>After months of deliberations, the New York State Gaming Commission has finally given the go-ahead for online gambling in the state. The decision was announced on Thursday, and it means that there will now be a range of legal gambling options available to New Yorkers, including casino games, poker, and sports betting.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a major boost for the gaming industry in New York, and it’s expected that there will be a rush to get online casinos up and running as soon as possible. There are already a number of operators who have expressed an interest in getting involved, and it’s thought that the market could be worth as much as $1 billion per year.</p>
<p>One of the big questions that remains is how this will affect existing land-based casinos in the state. Some operators had been pushing for online gambling to be restricted to those venues only, but it now looks like that won’t be the case. This could lead to some tension between different parts of the industry, with operators fighting for a slice of the cake.</p>
<p>It’s also not clear yet exactly how regulations will work in practice. For example, will people have to be physically present in New York to bet online, or will they be able to do so from anywhere in the world? These details are still being ironed out, but we should know more in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>In spite of these unanswered questions, there’s no doubt that online gambling is going to be a major force in New York State from now on. It’s set to provide a new source of revenue for the government, as well as creating jobs and boosting tourism. With so much at stake, it will be interesting to see how things play out in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="First-legal-online-poker-game-in-New-York-set-for-November"><a href="#First-legal-online-poker-game-in-New-York-set-for-November" class="headerlink" title="First legal online poker game in New York set for November"></a>First legal online poker game in New York set for November</h1><p>On November 1, the first legal online poker game in New York will take place. The game will be hosted by the Resorts World casino in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
<p>This is a major development for New York State, as it becomes one of the few states to allow legal online poker. Up until this point, online poker has been illegal in New York.</p>
<p>The new law allows for licensed casinos in New York State to offer online poker games to their customers. This includes both casino-style games and tournaments.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the games, players must be at least 21 years old and are required to create an account with the casino. Players must also reside in New York State.</p>
<p>The first game will be a $5 buy-in tournament with a $5,000 prize pool. The tournament will start at 7:00 p.m. on November 1 and will be open to the first 100 players who register.</p>
<p>There are a number of other tournaments planned for later in November, including a $15 buy-in tournament with a $10,000 prize pool on November 18 and a $30 buy-in tournament with a $25,000 prize pool on November 25.</p>
<p>Resorts World is planning on offering daily tournaments and cash games starting on November 1. There will be no rake charged on any of the New York State regulated games.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-players-can-now-legally-bet-online-in-New-York"><a href="#Casino-players-can-now-legally-bet-online-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="Casino players can now legally bet online in New York"></a>Casino players can now legally bet online in New York</h1><p>Since October 2018, online casino players have been able to legally place bets in the state of New York. This is thanks to the launch of a new sports betting platform by the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. The new platform allows bettors to make wagers on a range of sporting events, including major league baseball, basketball, and football games. </p>
<p>According to gaming regulators in the state, the new platform has been a success so far. In its first week of operation, over $3 million was wagered on the website. This is a clear sign that there is interest in online casino betting among New Yorkers. </p>
<p>The development of this online platform could not have come at a better time for Resorts Casino Hotel. The hotel has faced serious financial difficulties in recent years and has been forced to lay off staff and reduce services. The launch of the new sports betting platform could help to turnaround the hotel’s fortunes. </p>
<p>Players who want to take advantage of the new online casino betting service can do so by visiting the Resorts Casino Hotel website. There they will find a list of all the sporting events that are currently available for betting. Bettors can place wagers on everything from major league baseball games to European soccer matches. </p>
<p>The Resorts Casino Hotel is not the only casino in Atlantic City that offers online casino betting services. In fact, there are now a number of different platforms that allow New Yorkers to legally place bets online. This includes platforms offered by Caesars Entertainment, Golden Nugget Atlantic City, Hard Rock Atlantic City, and Tropicana Resort and Casino. </p>
<p>All these platforms offer a wide range of sporting events for bettors to choose from. They also offer some great promotional deals, including free bets and deposit bonuses. So if you’re looking for a legal way to bet on your favorite sports teams, then be sure to check out one of these platforms today!</p>

Governor Andrew Cuomo has signed a new bill into law that makes online gambling legal in the state. This means that residents can now play casino games, bet on sports, and play poker online for real money.</p>
<p>The new law will regulate and tax online gambling in New York. It is expected to generate $9 million in revenue annually for the state. The bill was passed by the state legislature in June and was signed by the governor on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Online gambling has been legal in other states for many years. However, New York is one of the first states to legalize it under its own laws. There are a number of restrictions in the new law, including a ban on playing poker against people located in other states.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo said that the new law will help boost tourism in New York. He added that it will also create jobs and generate revenue for the state government.</p>
<h1 id="November-1st-the-day-online-gambling-goes-live-in-New-York"><a href="#November-1st-the-day-online-gambling-goes-live-in-New-York" class="headerlink" title="November 1st: the day online gambling goes live in New York"></a>November 1st: the day online gambling goes live in New York</h1><p>Governor Cuomo of New York has announced that online gambling will be legal in the state as of November 1st. This move is being made in an effort to bolster the state’s sagging revenue, which has been hit hard by the recent recession.</p>
<p>Online gambling is nothing new; it has been legal in Nevada for years. However, this is the first time that it will be legal in a northeastern state. The hope is that this will lure gamblers who are currently spending their money in other states, such as Delaware and New Jersey.</p>
<p>The governor has stressed that there will be tight regulations in place to protect consumers. Players will be required to set up accounts with licensed operators, and they will be able to deposit only a limited amount of money each week. Operators will also be required to verify the identity of players and age of those who wish to gamble online.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin. They also point out that it is difficult to track down cheaters who try to fraudulently win money from casinos online. Supporters claim that these risks can be minimized through regulation, and that online gambling can be a fun and safe way for people to spend their leisure time.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how successful online gambling will be in New York. However, Governor Cuomo is optimistic, and believes that it could bring in as much as $1 billion in additional revenue each year.</p>
