<p>MGM has alleged that Pansy Ho is not the rightful owner of the casino, and filed a lawsuit seeking to have the casino’s ownership transferred to MGM.</p>
<p>Pansy Ho has responded by filing a countersuit, alleging that MGM is not the rightful owner of the casino.</p>
<p>The court case is currently ongoing, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>This dispute is just the latest in a long series of disputes between MGM and Pansy Ho over the ownership of casinos in Macau.</p>
<h1 id="MGM-steps-up-efforts-to-take-control-of-Bally-Wolf-casino"><a href="#MGM-steps-up-efforts-to-take-control-of-Bally-Wolf-casino" class="headerlink" title="MGM steps up efforts to take control of Bally Wolf casino"></a>MGM steps up efforts to take control of Bally Wolf casino</h1><p>MGM Resorts International is making a move to take control of the Bally Wolf casino in downtown Las Vegas. The Nevada Gaming Commission has approved a series of proposals from MGM, including the sale of its own property, the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, to billionaire investor Steve Wynn.</p>
<p>This would give Wynn a controlling interest in the Bally Wolf and clear the way for MGM to operate it. The vote was unanimous, with one commissioner recusing himself because he has business ties to MGM.</p>
<p>The proposed deal still needs to be approved by the gaming commission in Pennsylvania, where Bally Wolf is licensed. That approval is not seen as being a problem, as Wynn is already a major player in that state’s casino industry.</p>
<p>MGM has been trying to gain a foothold in Las Vegas’ downtown area for some time now. The company currently operates two properties there, but both are on the outskirts of the district. Taking over the Bally Wolf would give it a central location and allow it to compete more directly with Caesars Entertainment Corporation and its nine casinos in the area.</p>
<p>Caesars has been struggling financially in recent years, and some analysts believe that MGM’s move into the downtown market is an attempt to pick off some of its weaker properties.</p>
<h1 id="Pansy-Ho-vows-to-fight-MGM’s-takeover-of-Bally-Wolf-casino"><a href="#Pansy-Ho-vows-to-fight-MGM’s-takeover-of-Bally-Wolf-casino" class="headerlink" title="Pansy Ho vows to fight MGM’s takeover of Bally Wolf casino"></a>Pansy Ho vows to fight MGM’s takeover of Bally Wolf casino</h1><p>Hong Kong businesswoman Pansy Ho has vowed to fight MGM’s takeover of the Bally Wolf casino in Macau, describing the bid as “illegal and unjustified”.</p>
<p>MGM announced last week that it would acquire Ho’s 51% stake in the casino for $3.6 billion, making it the only operator on the island with a majority share.</p>
<p>Ho released a statement over the weekend condemning MGM’s actions and vowing to “take all necessary steps to protect our shareholders’ interests”.</p>
<p>Her company, Shun Tak Holdings, said it had already filed a complaint with the Macau government and intended to take further legal action.</p>
<p>“The Board of Directors of Shun Tak Holdings Limited believes that this offer is illegal and unjustified,” the statement read.</p>
<p>“Our company will take all necessary steps to protect our shareholders’ interests, including seeking legal advice and appealing to the relevant authorities.”</p>
<p>Macau’s Secretary for Economy and Finance Lionel Leong said earlier this week that he was reviewing the takeover proposal but had not yet made a decision on whether to approve it.</p>
<h1 id="Who-will-win-the-battle-for-control-of-Bally-Wolf-casino"><a href="#Who-will-win-the-battle-for-control-of-Bally-Wolf-casino" class="headerlink" title="Who will win the battle for control of Bally Wolf casino?"></a>Who will win the battle for control of Bally Wolf casino?</h1><p>The future of the Bally Wolf casino is up in the air, as two powerful moguls battle for control. On one side is casino magnate Don Corleone, who has been unsuccessfully trying to wrest control of Bally Wolf from the current owner, Nicky Barnes. On the other side is formidable rival, Tony Montana, who has made a fortune in real estate and recently began investing in casinos.</p>
<p>The two have been locked in a heated bidding war for Bally Wolf, with Corleone making several offers that have been rejected by Barnes. Montana has made a higher bid, but Corleone is not willing to give up easily. He has deep pockets and is prepared to go all out to win this casino.</p>
<p>Barnes is said to be holding out for a higher price, but he may not be able to resist for much longer. The pressure is mounting on him as Corleone ramps up his efforts to take over Bally Wolf. If he doesn’t sell soon, he may find himself out of a job and on the losing side of this battle.</p>
<p>Who will come out on top? Only time will tell!</p>
