<p>Gonzos Quest is a five-reel, 20-line video slot with a theme based on the lost city of gold, El Dorado. The game has a number of features including avalanche spins, wild substitutions and free falls.</p>
<p>“The new Gonzos Quest game is off to a fantastic start,” said Randy Pettingill, senior vice president of casino marketing for MGM Resorts International. “This is one of our most popular games and it’s great to see people winning big payouts so quickly.”</p>
<p>Gonzos Quest is one of several new games that have been added to the Bellagio casino floor in recent months. Other new games include Thunderstruck II, Game of Thrones and Jurassic Park.</p>

It is known for having some of the best payouts available, and when one of those payouts is made, the player often wants to know what Gonzos says.</p>
<p>The answer to that question may surprise you. While it is not known for sure what language Gonzos speaks, it is said that he speaks Dutch. So when you hear him speak after a large payout, you are likely hearing him say something in Dutch congratulating you on your good fortune.</p>
<p>Whether you are playing at an online casino or at a brick and mortar establishment, if you get lucky while playing Gonzos Quest, be sure to listen carefully for his congratulations in Dutch. It just might make your day a little bit brighter.</p>

Slot machine fans will be familiar with popular ones such as “allez-oop” and “doubledown”. However, there is one phrase in particular that often confuses new players, and that is Gonzos Quest Slot Machine’s “nice one”.</p>
<p>The phrase generally means that the machine has just given out a large payout, but some players believe that it has a deeper meaning. Some have even claimed that the “nice one” is a secret code used by casino staff to let other staff know that a large payout has been won. This has never been confirmed, but it adds to the excitement and mystery of playing slot machines.</p>
<p>Regardless of what the phrase actually means, it’s definitely a cause for celebration when you hear it come out of the machine!</p>

You’ve been playing it for a while and seem to have it all figured out, right? Guess again! Although this slot game may seem easy to play at first, there are actually quite a few secrets to winning that many players are not aware of. In this article, we’ll reveal some of the best tips and tricks for conquering Gonzos Quest and walking away with some serious winnings.</p>
<p>Secret #1: Choose Your Bet Wisely</p>
<p>The amount you bet on each spin of the Gonzos Quest slot machine can have a big impact on your eventual winnings. Ideally, you want to aim for a bet that gives you the best chance of winning without risking too much money. You can experiment with different bet amounts to find the perfect one for you, but a good starting point is usually around 0.50 per spin.</p>
<p>Secret #2: Use the Gamble Feature</p>
<p>If you want to increase your chances of winning even more while playing Gonzos Quest, then make sure to use the Gamble feature whenever it becomes available. This feature allows you to risk your current winnings in order to potentially double them – and it’s well worth taking the risk when the potential payout is so high. Just make sure not to gamble away too much money if things start going bad!</p>
<p>Secret #3: Look for Winning Combinations</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of playing Gonzos Quest successfully is knowing which symbols result in winning combinations. By familiarizing yourself with these combinations, you’ll be able to place better bets and increase your chances of winning big payouts.
