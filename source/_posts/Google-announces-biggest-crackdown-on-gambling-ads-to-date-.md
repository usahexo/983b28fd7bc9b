#  Google announces biggest crackdown on gambling ads to date 

On Wednesday, Google announced its plans for the biggest crackdown on gambling ads to date. The announcement comes as part of the company’s efforts to protect its users from harmful content.

According to Google, the crackdown will target both casinos and betting companies. Ads for these types of businesses will be completely banned from the company’s platforms, including Search, YouTube, and Gmail.

Google’s vice president of global product policy, David Carroll, said in a statement that the company is taking this step because “gambling can result in addictive behavior and can have a negative impact on vulnerable groups, such as young people.”

The crackdown is set to take effect in July and will apply globally. This means that not only will ads for casinos and betting companies be banned from Google’s platforms, but they will also be prohibited from being shown on any website that is indexed by the search engine.

This move by Google is likely to be welcomed by some who argue that online gambling can be addictive and damaging to society as a whole. However, it is also likely to provoke criticism from those who argue that such bans amount to censorship.

#  Google pledges to remove all gambling ads from its platforms 

Google has announced that it will be removing all gambling ads from its various platforms, including Search, YouTube, and Gmail. This move is in response to concerns expressed by lawmakers and consumer advocates about the potential for gambling addiction among users.

Google is not the only technology company to make this pledge; both Facebook and Apple have also vowed to remove all gambling-related ads from their respective platforms. However, Google is by far the largest player in the online advertising market, so this move is likely to have the greatest impact.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem, and it’s one that can have tragic consequences. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, nearly two million Americans are addicted to gambling, and another four to six million are considered “at-risk” for developing a problem.

The rise of online gambling has made it easier for people to gamble without having to leave their homes. This has led to an increase in gambling addiction rates, as well as an increase in the amount of money being lost by problem gamblers.

Technology companies have a responsibility to protect their users from harm, and that includes protecting them from addictive activities like gambling. By removing all gambling ads from their platforms, Google, Facebook, and Apple are sending a message that they take this responsibility seriously.

#  Google cracks down on gambling advertising with new policy update 

In an effort to protect consumers from predatory gambling practices, Google has announced a new policy update that will restrict ads for online gambling services.

This change means that Google will no longer allow advertisers to promote online casinos, sports betting, and other types of gambling-related services. The policy will go into effect in July 2018.

According to Google, the new policy is aimed at preventing "online platforms from becoming a hotbed for gambling-related issues." The company also emphasized its commitment to protecting consumers from fraudulent and deceptive practices.

Google's decision to crack down on gambling advertising comes as welcome news to many who have been critical of the online gambling industry. In recent years, there has been growing concern over the potential harmful effects of gambling, including addiction and financial losses.

Critics of online gambling say that the industry is particularly vulnerable to exploitation by predators, as it can be difficult for consumers to assess the trustworthiness of casinos and other gaming sites. And because so much money is at stake, some players can become desperate to recoup their losses, leading them into a cycle of addiction and debt.

By implementing this new policy, Google is taking a stand against these harmful practices and helping to protect consumers from harm.

#  Google updates policies to reduce gambling adverts across platforms 

Google has updated its advertising policies to reduce the number of gambling adverts shown on its platforms. This follows concerns that the adverts can be addictive and lead to financial problems for some users.

The new policy states that gambling companies can only advertise their products on Google if they are licensed in the country where the ads will be shown. In addition, Google will prohibit adverts for casinos, betting, and other forms of gambling from being shown on YouTube, its online search engine, and other platforms.

The move has been welcomed by campaigners who argue that the adverts can be harmful to young people. “Google’s move to block gambling ads is a significant step in protecting children and young people from the harms of gambling,” said Matt Zarb-Cousin of Fairer Gambling.

However, the new policy could have a negative impact on gambling companies, who will lose out on advertising revenue. “This change will cut off an important way that casino companies market their wares to potential customers,” said Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University.

#  How to block gambling ads on your phone

There are a number of ways to block gambling ads on your phone. We will explore a few of the most common methods.

The first method is to use an ad blocker. Some browsers, such as Chrome and Firefox, have add-ons or extensions that can be installed to block ads. There are also many third-party ad blockers available. Be sure to research which one is best for you before downloading.

Another way to block gambling ads is to use parental controls. Most smartphones have parental control settings that can be used to restrict certain types of content. This includes websites, apps, and even in-app purchases. Parents can also set time limits for how long their children can use their devices each day.

A third way to block gambling ads is by using a mobile VPN app. VPNs (virtual private networks) are services that allow users to encrypt their internet traffic and hide their IP address. This makes it difficult for advertisers or anyone else tracking online activity to determine which websites a person has visited. There are many VPN apps available, both free and paid. be sure to do your research before choosing one.

Finally, there are some devices that come with built-in features to help block gambling ads. The Apple iPhone, for example, has a setting called “Restrict Adult Content” that can be enabled in the settings menu. This will prevent Safari from loading any adult or gambling websites automatically. Android devices also have similar settings that can be found under “Content & Privacy Restrictions” in the settings menu
