Her family became concerned when they noticed that she wasn't sleeping, wasn't eating, and was losing interest in activities that she used to enjoy.

They did some research and found a gaming addiction help center that could provide her with the treatment she needed. After completing a 30-day program at the center, the young woman is now on the path to recovering from her addiction. She is back to sleeping and eating normally, and is once again enjoying her hobbies.

#  Daughter's gambling addiction forces parents to sell their home

When John and his wife decided to have children, they never imagined that one of them would develop a gambling addiction that would force them to sell their home. But that's exactly what happened to their daughter, who gradually began to lose control over her spending and eventually started gambling away the family's money.

At first, John and his wife tried to talk to their daughter about her problem and encourage her to get help. But she refused to listen, insisting that she could stop any time she wanted. The longer the addiction went untreated, the worse it became, until finally the family had no choice but to sell their home and move somewhere cheaper.

Unfortunately, even in a smaller home their daughter's addiction continued to spiral out of control. She would borrow money from friends or relatives, or even steal it outright, and then go right back to gambling it away. The family was at their wit's end; they didn't know what else to do.

Luckily, they were eventually able to find help for their daughter. With therapy and support from her family, she was eventually able to overcome her addiction. Today she is a successful professional with a happy family of her own.

#  Daughter's gambling addiction costs family over $100,000

When Jane's* parents caught her stealing from them to support her gambling addiction, they were devastated. Thomas and his wife had done everything they could to help their daughter, including cosigning on a loan to pay for her expensive gambling habit, but it had all been for naught.

Jane had started gambling in college and it had quickly become an addiction. She would gamble compulsively, even when she didn't have money to lose. The thrill of the bet was too strong for her to resist, and she was determined to beat the odds no matter what the cost.

Unfortunately, the cost was high. The family had already lost over $100,000 on Jane's gambling habit, and there seemed to be no end in sight. Her parents were at their wit's end and didn't know what else to do.

They considered therapy or rehab, but those were both very expensive options. And even if they could afford it, Jane was vehemently opposed to either one. She insisted that she could handle her addiction on her own and refused to seek help.

So Thomas and his wife decided to take a different tack. They stopped supporting Jane financially and cut off all communication with her. It was a hard decision, but they felt like they had no other choice. They were losing too much money and their daughter wasn't getting any better.

Eventually, Jane hit rock bottom and realized she needed help. She sought out therapy and rehab and is now doing much better. Her parents are happy that she is getting the help she needs, but they still regret how much money they lost in the process.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. There is no shame in admitting that you need help and getting the support you need to overcome your addiction. You can get started by contacting your local Gamblers Anonymous chapter or by talking to your doctor about treatment options.*Name has been changed

#  Gambling addiction therapy helps daughter and her family recover from casino losses

A daughter's story of how gambling addiction therapy helped her and her family recover from casino losses.

This is my story. It’s not a unique one, but it’s mine. And I’m grateful for the lessons it’s taught me.

It started with my parents. They were always gambling—playing the slots, blackjack, and poker at the casino. They would come home with stories of their great wins and how they were going to pay off all our debts. But inevitably, they would also come home with tales of their devastating losses. I would watch as they argued about money, piling debt onto debt. And then one day, it was my turn to get sucked in.

I was 18 and had just started college. My parents gave me some money to play with at the casino and I couldn’t believe my luck when I won big on my very first try! From then on, I was hooked; I spent every penny I could spare at the casino, convinced that this time I would break even at least. But of course, that didn’t happen. In fact, each time I played only led to bigger and bigger losses. Before long, I had racked up tens of thousands of dollars in debt—debt that I couldn’t repay even if I won back all the money I had lost.

I felt like a total failure. Here I was, barely out of high school and already in too deep financially. There was no way out—or so I thought. That’s when my mom suggested we seek out help from a gambling addiction therapist . At first, I was hesitant; after all, who wanted to admit they had a problem? But eventually, I agreed to try it out .

The therapist we saw was amazing . She helped us realize that we weren’t bad people for getting addicted to gambling; we were simply caught up in something that was incredibly powerful and addictive . She showed us how to set boundaries for ourselves so that we could gamble responsibly (something my parents had never been able to do). Most importantly, she helped us rebuild our relationship with each other . We started talking again—actually talking , not just arguing about money . The therapy sessions gave us back our family and our lives .

If you or someone you love is struggling with a gambling addiction , please don’t hesitate to seek out help . There is definitely hope and there are people who can supportive through the recovery process .
