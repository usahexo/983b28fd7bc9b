A lucky player hit a $157,000 jackpot on the Gonzos Quest slot machine at the Bellagio in Las Vegas on Saturday – less than four hours after the game went into service.

Gonzos Quest is a five-reel, 20-line video slot with a theme based on the lost city of gold, El Dorado. The game has a number of features including avalanche spins, wild substitutions and free falls.

"The new Gonzos Quest game is off to a fantastic start," said Randy Pettingill, senior vice president of casino marketing for MGM Resorts International. "This is one of our most popular games and it's great to see people winning big payouts so quickly."

Gonzos Quest is one of several new games that have been added to the Bellagio casino floor in recent months. Other new games include Thunderstruck II, Game of Thrones and Jurassic Park.
