 dealer," Eddie mutters as he pushes away from the blackjack table, leaving his $5 chip on the felt. It's his third win in a row. "I think my good luck is rubbing off on you," the dealer says with a smile.

#  Group of Amateurs Win Big Playing Blackjack

A group of friends who met playing blackjack in their spare time have beaten the casinos at their own game – and made a fortune doing it.

The foursome, who only ever played for fun and never took the game too seriously, started out by pooling their money to increase their chances of winning. But very quickly they found they could beat the house by using a simple strategy which exploits the fact that blackjack is a ‘negative expectation’ game.

In other words, over time the house will always win because the odds are against players winning. But by following a few simple rules, the group has managed to minimise the house edge and come out on top more times than not.

“It’s all about making sensible choices and playing smart,” one of the members of the group told us. “We don’t bet more than we can afford to lose and we never stand on 16 or below. By doing that we give ourselves the best chance possible of winning – even against some of the casino’s best dealers.”

The group has been so successful that they have now decided to quit their day jobs and focus on blackjack full-time. And they’re not alone; there are now many professional blackjack players who make a living from betting on the game.

But don’t let that put you off; with a bit of practice and some basic knowledge you could be joining them soon enough. Just remember to stick to sensible betting patterns and never risk more than you can afford to lose!

#  Husband and Wife Battle It Out at Blackjack Table

It was just another day at the casino for husband and wife duo Larry and Lucy. They had been playing blackjack together for years, and they were pretty evenly matched.

Today, however, something was different. Larry was on a hot streak and kept winning hand after hand. Lucy was getting frustrated, and her impatience started to show.

She started to make careless mistakes, like doubling down when she shouldn't have, or splitting pairs when she should have stuck with one card.Larry took advantage of her every time, and his lead grew larger and larger.

Finally, Lucy had had enough. She blew her stack and accused Larry of cheating. He denied it vehemently, but she didn't believe him. The two of them argued until they were practically screaming at each other.

The other casino-goers were starting to stare, so they decided to call it quits and go their separate ways. As they walked away from the blackjack table, Larry couldn't help but feel victorious.

#  Couple Goes on Epic Winning Streak in Blackjack Game

A couple out for a fun night of casino gaming went on an epic winning streak in the blackjack game last night, walking away with more than $10,000 in winnings.

John and Beth started by winning small pots to get their confidence up, and then began to hit some big hands. They were quite lucky in that they didn't lose any sizable bets either, meaning their profits mounted steadily as the night went on.

"We just kept getting good cards and making smart choices," says John. "It was really exciting."

Beth agrees: "We were both feeling pretty good about ourselves by the end! I don't think either of us has ever won that much money at once before."

The two are adamant about not letting the winnings go to their heads though - they're already talking about what they'll do with the extra cash. A nice dinner out and maybe even a weekend away are top contenders!
