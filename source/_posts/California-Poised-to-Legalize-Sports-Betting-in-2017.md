#  California Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in 2017

A flurry of recent activity indicates that California is on the brink of legalizing sports betting in the state. The big question is when will it happen?

On October 11, 2017, Assemblyman Adam Gray introduced Assembly Bill AB 2888, which would legalize sports betting in California. This was not the first time that Gray had tried to legalize sports betting in the state; he also introduced a similar bill in 2016.

AB 2888 would allow casinos in California to offer sports betting, including bets on professional and college sporting events. It would also authorize the state’s three horse racing tracks – Santa Anita Park, Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, and Golden Gate Fields – to offer sports betting.

Gray argues that legalizing sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to the state. “This is an important issue that deserves serious consideration,” he said in a statement. “The potential revenues from legalized sports betting are significant and could help fund important public programs like education and healthcare.”

Even if AB 2888 does pass, there is still some uncertainty about when Californians will be able to start placing bets on sporting events. That’s because the bill requires a vote from the people of California before it can take effect. The earliest that vote could take place is November 2018.

Meanwhile, lawmakers in other states are moving forward with plans to legalize sports betting. In early October 2017, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill that would allow casinos in Atlantic City to offer sports betting. The bill had been passed by the New Jersey legislature earlier in the year.

Many observers believe that Christie’s action was intended to put pressure on the U.S. Supreme Court, which is currently considering a case that could overturn a federal ban on sports gambling. If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of New Jersey, it would pave the way for other states to legalize sports betting as well.

#  California Sports Betting Bill Gets Second Chance in Legislature

After a previous attempt stalled in the state legislature, California lawmakers are giving a new bill to legalize sports betting another chance.

Assembly Bill 286 would allow casinos in California to offer sports betting, with the state taking a cut of the profits. The bill is sponsored by Assemblymember Adam Gray, who believes the additional revenue could help plug the state’s budget deficit.

Sports betting is currently legal in only four states: Nevada, Delaware,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) Montana, and Oregon. New Jersey has been trying to legalize it since 2011, but has been blocked by the leagues and the Department of Justice. In May of this year, the Supreme Court overturned that decision, opening up the possibility for other states to legalize it.

Gray’s bill passed through two committees in the Assembly this week and now moves on to the full Assembly for a vote. If it passes there, it will move on to the Senate for approval. Governor Jerry Brown has not taken a position on the bill.

#  California Assembly Passes Bill to Legalize Sports Betting

On Tuesday, the California Assembly voted in favor of a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The vote was 56-18, with two members not voting.

The bill, AB 1437, now goes to the Senate for consideration. If it is approved there, it will go to Governor Jerry Brown for his signature.

If signed into law, the bill would allow California’s Indian tribes to offer sports betting at their casinos. It would also allow people over 21 years of age to place bets online and via mobile devices.

The passage of the bill comes as no surprise, as there has been growing momentum in recent years to legalize sports betting nationwide. In May, the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban onSports Gambling, opening up the possibility for states to legalize it within their borders.

Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including New Jersey, Delaware and West Virginia. Pennsylvania is expected to pass a similar bill in the coming weeks.

#  California Senators Approve Measure to Legalize Sports Betting

The move could pave the way for other states to legalize gambling, and is being seen as a victory for the casino industry.

On Monday, the California State Senate voted in favor of a measure that would legalize sports betting in the state. The measure now goes to the Assembly, where it is also expected to pass.

If it becomes law, California would become the fifth state to legalize sports betting, following New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia.

The move is being seen as a victory for the casino industry, which has been fighting for legalization for years. Supporters argue that legalizing sports betting will bring in much-needed tax revenue, and that it can be regulated to prevent cheating and other abuses.

Opponents argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for those who gamble too much. They also say that it can damage the integrity of sporting events.

So far, only New Jersey has actually launched legal sports betting operations. Other states are still working out the details of how it will be implemented.

After months of deliberations and a few failed attempts, it looks as if the California state legislature is finally ready to legalize sports betting. The move would make the most populous U.S. state the fifth in the nation to allow sports wagers, after Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey and West Virginia.

Legislators have been attempting to push through a sports betting bill all year, but some were concerned about the potential for addiction and other social ills associated with gambling. There was also disagreement about who should be able to offer sports betting services – casinos only, or also horse racing tracks and other establishments.

But now it appears that a compromise has been reached which will allow both casinos and other gaming establishments to offer sports betting services. The bill is expected to be voted on next week and, if approved, could go into effect by the end of the year.

This would be great news for California’s economy, which is currently struggling with a budget deficit of $21 billion. Proponents of legalizing sports betting believe that it could bring in an additional $1 billion in tax revenue each year. This could help offset some of the state’s financial issues while also providing much-needed jobs in the casino industry.

It’s unclear exactly how much money is spent on sports betting in California each year, but it’s safe to say that it’s a lot more than the $134 million that was wagered legally in 2017. Much of this gambling takes place through illegal offshore websites, so legalizing sports betting would allow the state to capture some of this money and put it towards important causes such as education and infrastructure improvements.

Not everyone is on board with legalizing sports betting, however. Some religious groups oppose any form of gambling, arguing that it can lead to financial ruin for those who participate. Others worry that widespread legalization will lead to increased corruption in professional sports leagues like the NFL and NBA.
