#  How did the author compile the recipes in the book?

One of the things that I love about Julia Turshen’s cookbook, “Small Victories”, is that it is a compilation of recipes from people all over the world. Each recipe has a personal story from the author or one of their contributors. The book was compiled in a very unique way – through social media.

Turshen solicited recipes from her followers on Instagram and Twitter. She then hand-selected the best ones to include in her cookbook. This gave the book a very personal feel, as if you were sitting down with your friends and family and cooking together.

I was intrigued by this process, so I decided to try it myself! I asked my followers on Instagram for their favorite comfort food recipes. I received some amazing submissions, and I can’t wait to share them with you.
