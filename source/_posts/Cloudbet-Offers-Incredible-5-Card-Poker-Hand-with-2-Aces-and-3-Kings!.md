#  Cloudbet Offers Incredible 5 Card Poker Hand with 2 Aces and 3 Kings!

A few weeks ago I was sitting at the Cloudbet online casino playing 5 card poker. I had a great hand with 2 aces and 3 kings. The next player folded and the dealer put out the final card- an ace. This gave me a fantastic 5 card poker hand with 2 aces and 3 kings!

I was really excited as I thought I might win a nice pot. Unfortunately, when it came time to show my cards, the other player had also got a royal flush! This happens sometimes in poker, but it was still disappointing to lose out on such a big pot.

Even though I didn’t win, it was still great fun to play and I’ll definitely be back at Cloudbet soon to try my luck again! If you want to experience some of the best poker action around, then make sure you check out Cloudbet today!

It was a historic moment at Cloudbet when gambler ‘DooMx3’ hit a royal flush playing 5 card poker and walked away with a magnificent payout of 103.8 BTC (then worth over $600,000 USD!).

What made this win even more impressive was the fact that DooMx3 only had a 2% chance of winning the hand. In other words, it was an almost impossible feat – but that’s what makes gambling so exciting!
